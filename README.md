## About the project
 Here you will find my final degree thesis at University of C√≥rdoba, Spain. This project tries to manage user/business bookings at real time and offering a pleasant user experience through different mobile apps

The purpose of this project is to learn new technologies like NestJS and React Native using mono-repo with Nx.dev and apply concepts about Software Desing like Event Modeling, Domain-Driven-Desing, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Clean code, Test Driven Development, etc.

## Key Features

* **Design**: Event modeling.
* **Arquitecture**: Hexagonal Arquitecture following Domain-Driven-Design concepts.
* **Database management**: CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns.
  * **Read model**: MongoDB.
  * **Write model**: Event Store.
* **Unit and integration testing**: Jest.
